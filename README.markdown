### Requirements

* Requires the [httplib2](http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/) library. It's just so much better than the standard library that it's worth introducing a dependency.
* Requires either Python 2.6 (which includes [json](http://docs.python.org/library/json.html) in the standard library) or, if using an earlier Python 2.x version, the [simplejson](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/) library.
